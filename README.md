# C++ Search Engine App

## Introduction
The C++ Search Engine App is a comprehensive tool designed to index and search through multiple files efficiently. It consists of various components including a file reader, analyzer, statistics generator, indexer, scheduler, and search engine. This project aims at designing a search system to retrieve and display valuable search results from extensive documents, applying object-oriented programming to enhance code modularity, maintainability, and reusability.

## Features
- **File Reader**:
  - Reads input files and extracts content for analysis.

- **Analyzer**:
  - Analyzes file content to extract keywords and metadata.

- **Statistics Generator**:
  - Generates statistical information about the indexed documents.

- **Indexer**:
  - Indexes keywords and their occurrences along with file references.

- **Scheduler**:
  - Orchestrates indexing and searching tasks efficiently.

- **Search Engine**:
  - Performs keyword searches across indexed files.
  - Ranks search results based on relevance and provides efficient retrieval.

## Technologies Used
- C++

## Usage
1. Use the file reader component to input files into the system.
2. The analyzer will process the files to extract keywords and metadata.
3. Statistics can be generated to provide insights into the indexed documents.
4. Indexer component indexes the keywords and their occurrences along with file references.
5. Scheduler orchestrates indexing and searching tasks efficiently.
6. Utilize the search engine component to perform keyword searches across indexed files and retrieve relevant results.

## Object-Oriented Design
- The system is designed using object-oriented programming principles to enhance code modularity, maintainability, and reusability.
- Components such as file reader, analyzer, indexer, scheduler, and search engine are implemented as classes with well-defined interfaces.
- Design patterns such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are employed to create a scalable and extensible search engine system.
